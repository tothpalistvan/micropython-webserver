About:
------
This is an example mPy based website with some MCU based action. 

In this example you able to save your webservers configuration...(You can find it in Wifi page)

(I think I reached the memory limit, so other menus can be implemented in separate file.)

Install:
--------
Just copy `_superpyhtml_.py` and the `html` folder to root of your ESP device. Don't forget to copy the webserver too.
